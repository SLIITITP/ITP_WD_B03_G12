#### Brief Description of Project - 
An animal clinic management system is a system that is used to manage the daily work of a pet 
clinic. This system is also available for clients. The pets will be registered through the system and their key 
details such as vaccination details will be stored making the animal book digitalize. A user must add at 
least one animal and can add many more. As the clinic, they can manage their doctors, staff, pets, and 
their owners, and store items through the system. An online store is also available to customers which 
has many useful items. Users can make an appointment prior to the clinic visit. A daily schedule will be 
published containing working doctors, and appointment numbers on that specific day. Medical history 
with prescribed medications will be saved for each pet after the doctor’s visit. The reports about admitted 
animals will be stored in the system. The clinic’s shelters can be easily managed by using this system. A 
bill will be calculated according to the services provided by the animal clinic. 

Most animal clinics have many problems such as a lack of real-time situation management, various 
changes in the vaccination details of animals, are unable to track previously prescribed drugs, hard-tofind 
medical history, errors with manually calculated bills, ineffective internal communication etc. Our 
proposed solution will reduce the paperwork manual work which will reduce the errors. The system will 
store the previous information for easy access. 

This application allows the clinic to manage and analyze its staff, animals, and space and store 
more efficiently. The system helps owners to clearly understand the clinic and make decisions more 
effectively which leads to good revenue. This system also ensures doctor-client relationship is more 
organized
